Examining the relationship between built environment (BE) and urban vitality (UV) is beneficial for promoting urban planning, as it deepens the understanding of how spatial design shapes urban life and activity patterns. However, the nonlinear effects of BE on UV from a spatiotemporal perspective have not been fully explored. In this study, the central urban area of Chongqing at the block scale is selected as a research case. The Gradient Boosting Decision Tree with SHapley Additive exPlanations (GBDT-SHAP) model is used to examine the nonlinear impacts of BE on UV. The results show the following: (1) The BE has a stronger overall impact on UV during holidays. Road intersection density (RID) has the greatest impact on UV on weekdays and holidays, building density (BD) has the greatest impact on weekend mornings, cultural and leisure accessibility (CLA) has the greatest impact on weekend afternoons, and commercial accessibility (CA) has the most significant impact on weekend evenings; (2) the impacts of the BE on UV exhibit significant nonlinear characteristics, with BD and park and square accessibility (PSA) showing a first increasing and then inhibiting effect on UV; lower CA, CLA, and MSA have inhibitory effects on UV, with higher normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values similarly demonstrating such effects; building height (BH), bus stop density (BSD), road network density (RD), and RID have enhancing effects on UV; functional mix degree (FMD) and water proximity index (WPI) show different trends in different time periods; (3) there are significant interactive effects among BE such as BD and BH, CA; RD and WPI, MSA; FMD and BH, PSA; PSA and CLA. A comprehensive understanding of these interactive relationships is crucial for optimizing the BE to enhance UV. This study provides a theoretical basis for urban planners to develop more effective, time-sensitive strategies. Future research should explore these nonlinear and interactive effects across different cities and scales to further generalize the findings.
