Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a complex psychological disorder caused by multiple factors, which are not only related to individual psychological states but also closely linked to physiological responses, social environments, and personal experiences. Therefore, traditional single data source assessment methods are difficult to fully understand and evaluate the complexity of PTSD. To overcome this challenge, the focus of this study is on developing a PTSD risk assessment model based on multi-modal data fusion. The importance of multi-modal data fusion lies in its ability to integrate data from different dimensions and provide a more comprehensive PTSD risk assessment. For multi-modal data fusion, two sets of solutions are proposed: the first is to extract EEG features using B-spline basis functions, combined with questionnaire data, to construct a multi-modal Zero-Inflated Poisson regression model; the second is to build a multi-modal deep neural network fusion prediction model to automatically extract and fuse multi-modal data features. The results show that the multi-modal data model is more accurate than the single data model, with significantly improved prediction ability. Zero-inflated Poisson models are prone to over-fitting when data is limited, while deep neural network models show superior performance in both training and prediction sets, especially the Hybrid LSTM-FCNN model, which not only has high accuracy but also strong generalization ability. This study proves the potential of multi-modal data fusion in PTSD prediction, and the Hybrid LSTM-FCNN model stands out for its high accuracy and good generalization ability, providing scientific evidence for early warning of PTSD in rescue personnel. Future research can further explore model optimization and clinical applications to promote the mental health maintenance of rescue personnel.
