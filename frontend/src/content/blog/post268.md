In conventional hydrology, a short-duration design rainstorm is typically used to estimate the design discharge in urban sewer systems. The reason for using a short duration is that engineers believe the time of concentration in urban watersheds is relatively small. The short-duration hyetograph is supposed to generate a flow hydrograph that accurately reflects the rainfall-runoff processes. In this study, we developed a street-sewer runoff model for an urban district of 2470 hectares. Detailed field flooding records were utilized to verify the stormwater model&amp;rsquo;s capability for inundation simulations. Subsequently, different rainfall series extracted from the recorded rainstorm data were used to investigate the causes of flooding corresponding to different durations of rainstorms. The results indicate that a 90 min main concentrated rainstorm causes small-scale flooding only; however, a 24 h rainfall series results in an extensive range of inundations. We further conducted similar short- and long-duration hyetograph tests in 16 urban drainage partitions (ranging from 2.3 to 193.5 hectares) to confirm the above findings. The results indicate that the maximum discharge in most partitions can only be found when the hyetograph duration exceeds 1080 min, which essentially contradicts previous engineering designs in urban watersheds in Taiwan.
