Thermochromic materials have attracted interest in textile applications, particularly in printing and dyeing processes. However, their thermochromic properties and impact on fabric comfort remain underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the thermochromic properties of printed fabrics with green-to-brown transitions and evaluates their comfort attributes. In the present study, a thermochromic dye paste was applied to nylon/cotton medium-weight fabric via screen printing process. The brown pigment paste was applied first, followed by the thermochromic olive green dye. The printed fabrics were tested for thermochromism, morphology, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and comfort properties. Comfort properties were assessed via air permeability, water vapour permeability, and moisture management tests. The results show reversible colour changes from green (25 &amp;deg;C) to brown (40 &amp;deg;C), with increasing lightness (L*) and shifting green&amp;ndash;red coordinates (&amp;minus;a*). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed uniform dye dispersion, and the FTIR validated the presence of thermochromic pigments. The printed fabrics showed a reduction in air permeability from 40.2 mm/s to 0 mm/s, while water vapour permeability decreased by 62.50% compared to the pristine fabric due to the coating layers. The overall moisture management properties of the printed fabric remained similar to those of the unprinted fabric, with a grade of 1. These findings highlight the potential of thermochromic textiles for adaptive camouflage, particularly in military uniforms, contributing to the advancement of intelligent textiles with enhanced thermal responsiveness.
