This study investigates the impact of web-based augmented reality (Web AR) on destination visit intention through the lens of a stimulus&amp;ndash;organism&amp;ndash;response (SOR) framework, a technology acceptance model (TAM) and flow theory into an integrated theoretical framework. This study aims to address gaps in the literature by providing insights about the relevance of augmented reality to tourism marketing effectiveness. Structural equation modeling was used to test this conceptual framework using AMOS23 on quantitative data collected from questionnaires distributed locally and internationally and applied to 384 participants after going through a Web AR destination experience. The findings confirmed that Web AR stimuli (i.e., interactivity and vividness) positively impact tourists&amp;rsquo; destination visit intention through the tourist organism in terms of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived certainty, perceived enjoyment and perceived immersion. Therefore, the promotion of destinations through augmented reality technology contributes to the development of sustainable tourism. The findings of this study will shed light on an alternative idea for destination marketing to inspire destination management organizations (DMOs) wishing to develop a competitive edge and win within the tourism industry. The results thus contribute to the Web AR and the tourism marketing literature by providing theoretical guidance through a framework for the AR tourism experience, as well as a reference for DMOs.
