The cell membrane plays a critical role in regulating substance exchange, signal transduction, and energy conversion, making it essential for maintaining homeostasis and responding to environmental stimuli. Ultrasound is a non-invasive, low-toxic modality that penetrates deep tissues, offering a promising alternative to traditional physical stimuli for advancing cell membrane research. This review focuses on the approaches by which ultrasound interacts with cell membranes and highlights its diverse biomedical applications. Key approaches of ultrasound&amp;ndash;membrane interaction include cavitation, sonoporation, and mechanotransduction, which have been harnessed in drug delivery, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Furthermore, we discuss current challenges and future directions to advance the clinical and research potential of this field. Ultrasound-mediated membrane modulation serves as a bridge between fundamental biological studies and clinical translation.
