Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifactorial, degenerative joint disease that significantly impairs mobility and quality of life, especially among older adults. The growing aging population and increasing obesity rates are expected to increase the incidence and prevalence of OA. In the absence of Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARDs) for OA, current treatment strategies largely focus on symptom relief rather than disease modification. These symptomatic treatments often fail to account for the substantial inter-individual variability in drug response. Pharmacogenomics (PGx), the study of how genetic variation influences drug response, offers a promising approach to personalize OA therapy. This review explores the clinical and pharmacogenomic considerations of commonly used OA medications&amp;mdash;acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), duloxetine, and tramadol&amp;mdash;focusing on gene&amp;ndash;drug interactions that influence efficacy, safety, and metabolism. Evidence-based recommendations from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines are discussed, where applicable, to highlight actionable genetic variants in very important pharmacogenes such as CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and other important drug-metabolizing encoding genes such as CYP2E1 and UGT1A6. While PGx data are not currently embedded in OA clinical treatment guidelines, their integration into clinical practice may enhance therapeutic outcomes and minimize adverse drug events. This review underscores the potential of PGx as a clinical tool in OA pain management, paving the way toward truly personalized medicine.
