After the arrival of Jesuits in China during the late Ming dynasty, they adopted a strategy of aligning Catholicism with Confucianism, referring to themselves as &amp;ldquo;Western Confucians&amp;rdquo; to gain sympathy and support from the Chinese literati. However, during the early Qing dynasty, particularly during the late Kangxi era, because of the resurgence of traditional Confucian ideology and the consolidation of Manchu rule, literati attitudes toward Catholicism shifted significantly. This paper uses the early Qing scholar Dong Han (&amp;#33891;&amp;#21547;, 1626&amp;ndash;?) from the Songjiang region as a case study, with his Notes in Three Hills &amp;#19977;&amp;#20872;&amp;#35782;&amp;#30053; as the primary textual source, to analyze his critiques of Western learning (including Catholicism and Western science). Additionally, it examines Catholic responses to these critiques, based on the manuscript Refute the False Accusation &amp;#36777;&amp;#35820; collected in the BnF (Biblioth&amp;egrave;que nationale de France). Through an analysis of Dong Han&amp;rsquo;s attitude toward Western learning and the responses it provoked, the paper aims to shed light on the changing attitudes of early Qing literati in the Jiangnan area toward Western learning, as well as the challenges faced by Catholicism in establishing their legitimacy in early modern China. It points out that the fundamental differences between Western learning and Confucianism prevented it from making an effective argument for legitimacy in China. The lack of support from the literati and the emperor led to the eventual fate of Catholicism&amp;mdash;being prohibited.
