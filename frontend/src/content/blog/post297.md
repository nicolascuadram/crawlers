The dissipation of excessive heat in high-power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) is essential for maintaining luminous efficiency, color stability, and device lifetime. While the incorporation of thermal vias in substrates is commonly used to improve heat dissipation, increasing their number is difficult in the limited area due to fabrication constraints. In this study, we use finite element analysis to investigate the effects of thermal via configurations on LED performance, including variations in the number of vias, spacing between vias, and their misalignment relative to the LED, arising from manufacturing tolerances. We found that the reduction in LED temperature saturated beyond a certain number of vias. Moreover, heat reduction can be further enhanced by optimizing the spacing between vias under a fixed number of vias. Based on these findings, the design of via configurations can achieve both fabrication feasibility and effective heat dissipation in high-power LEDs.
