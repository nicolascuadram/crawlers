An Abramson-type oblique-incident interferometer was used for the surface-form measurement of hand-scraped marks consisting of rough surfaces. Although the Abramson interferometer could measure the rough surface of hand-scraped marks under noncontact conditions, the inconsistency in the measurement results was caused by the differences in the incident direction of the measuring light. This study investigated the inconsistency in the measurement results of the Abramson interferometer caused by the oblique incidence of the measuring light. The reproducibility of inconsistencies due to the difference in the incident direction of the measuring light was confirmed, and the relationship between the inconsistency of the measurement results and the incident angle of the measuring light was investigated. Consequently, it was confirmed that the inconsistency of the measurement results due to the difference in the incident direction of the measuring light could be reduced by decreasing the incident angle of the measuring light. To avoid the overcrowding of the interference fringes caused by the reduction in the incident angle of the measuring light, an oblique-incident interferometer with a near-infrared laser was constructed. The validity of the developed oblique-incident interferometer was evaluated by comparison with a commercially available contour measurement instrument. The surface form obtained by the developed oblique-incident interferometer was confirmed to be consistent with the envelope of the cross-sectional profile measured by the contour measurement instrument.
