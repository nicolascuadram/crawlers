Inclusion is among the greatest challenges worldwide for educational systems. The present study examines the attitudes towards inclusion of parents of neurotypical children attending inclusive mainstream primary schools in Cyprus and Greece. Moreover, it addresses potential links between parental inclusion attitudes and different aspects of inclusive education, such as accommodation of different special educational needs (SENs), willingness to establish contact with children with SENs and their families, and knowledge of the strengths and difficulties of children with SENs. The participants were 202 parents from Cyprus and 166 parents from Greece who filled in a 74-item questionnaire. The results indicated that both Greek and Cypriot parents held good knowledge of the characteristics of children with SENs and positive attitudes towards the inclusion of children with SENs. Both groups of parents believed that certain disability categories can be more easily accommodated in mainstream schools. Parental beliefs towards inclusion were found to moderately predict attitudes towards the accommodation of SENs, willingness to develop and maintain social contact with the families of children with SENs, and ability attribution to children with SENs. This study suggests the importance of taking into account parental factors to improve attitudes and behaviors towards inclusion.
