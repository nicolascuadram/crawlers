Abstract:In this work, we present a numerical method for the initial-boundary value problem (IBVP) of first-order hyperbolic systems with source terms. The scheme directly solves the relaxation system using a relatively coarse mesh and captures the equilibrium behavior quite well, even in the presence of boundary layers. This method extends the concept of asymptotic-preserving schemes from initial-value problems to IBVPs. Moreover, we apply this idea to design a unified numerical scheme for the interface problem of relaxation systems.
