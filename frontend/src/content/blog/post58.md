Rock-breaking cutters are critical components in tunneling, mining, and drilling operations, where efficiency, durability, and energy consumption are paramount. Traditional cutter designs and empirical process optimization methods often fail to address the dynamic interaction between heterogeneous rock masses and tool structures, leading to premature wear, high specific energy, and suboptimal performance. Topology optimization, as an advanced computational design method, offers transformative potential for lightweight, high-strength cutter structures and adaptive cutting process control. This review systematically examines recent advancements in topology-optimized cutter design and its integration with rock-cutting mechanics. The structural innovations in cutter geometry and materials are analyzed, emphasizing solutions for stress distribution, wear/fatigue resistance, and dynamic load adaptation. The numerical methods for modeling rock&amp;ndash;tool interactions are introduced, including discrete element method (DEM) simulations, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods, and machine learning (ML)-enhanced predictive models. The cutting process optimization strategies that leverage topology optimization to balance objectives such as energy efficiency, chip formation control, and tool lifespan are evaluated.
