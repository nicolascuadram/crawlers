The bifurcation and chaotic oscillations and stability of perfect/imperfect FG fluttering plate on nonlinear elastic foundations exposed to parametric forcing excitation are examined. Based on modified rule of mixture and considering three types of porosities, even, uneven, and logarithmic uneven porosity, and taking into account the movement of the physical neutral surface, the effective mechanical characteristics of the porous plate are obtained. The geometrical nonlinearity is modeled utilizing the von Karman nonlinear strain–displacement relations. The nonlinear coupled PDEs of the system are derived using the extended Hamilton’s principle. Finally, for the purpose of reducing the equations to Mathieu type nonlinear ordinary differential equations, the Galerkin’s technique is employed. To validate the formulation of Limit Cycle Oscillations, the results are compared with those reported in the literature, and the convergency of the solutions is investigated. The parametric resonance beyond the supersonic flutter instability is investigated and the corresponding stability boundaries are determined using the multiple scales technique. At the steady-state conditions, the resonance characteristic curves are obtained. The impact of porosity index, volume fraction index, frequency parameter, forcing amplitude and perturbed dynamic pressure on nonlinear vibrations of the perfect/imperfect FG-plate are examined. In this study, the Runge-Kutta technique is used to demonstrate that varying the forcing control parameters can result in chaotic and multi-periodic motions.
