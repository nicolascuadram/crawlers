This study presents the formulation and evaluation of a dual molecular weight polymer gel system composed of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and crosslinked with polyethyleneimine (PEI) for water shut-off applications. A soft gel, designed for deep reservoir penetration, was formulated using 5000 ppm[...] Read more.
