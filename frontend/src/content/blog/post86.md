Biochar-based materials have gathered increasing attention as sustainable catalysts for carbon dioxide (CO2) valorization, offering a green alternative to traditional metal-based systems. Produced from renewable biomass through pyrolysis, biochar possesses key features&amp;mdash;such as high surface area, rich porosity and tunable surface chemistry&amp;mdash;that make it particularly suited for heterogeneous catalysis. This review highlights recent advances in the use of biochar-derived catalysts for key CO2 conversion reactions, focusing on cycloaddition to epoxides, dry reforming of methane and catalytic biomass upgrading. Emphasis is given to the role of biochar&amp;rsquo;s origin and preparation methods, which critically influence its structure, surface functionality and catalytic performance. Feedstocks rich in mineral content or oxygenated groups, for instance, can enhance CO2 activation and product selectivity. Furthermore, tailored modifications&amp;mdash;such as doping with heteroatoms or supporting metal nanoparticles&amp;mdash;further boost catalytic activity and stability by tuning acid&amp;ndash;base behavior, while maintaining low toxicity and cost-effectiveness. Compared to conventional catalysts, biochar-based systems offer advantages in low cost, recyclability and resistance to deactivation. Challenges remain in standardizing production methods, controlling structural variability, minimizing metal leaching and scaling up. This review presents biochar as a versatile, renewable platform for CO2 utilization, highlighting the importance of rational design, feedstock selection and functionalization strategies for developing efficient, sustainable catalytic systems, in line with green chemistry and circular economy principles.
