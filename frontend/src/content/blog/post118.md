Background/Objectives: This study investigates the evolution of hospital capacity and utilization in California between 2003 and 2023, focusing on emergency departments (EDs) and trauma centers (TCs). We seek to document structural changes in the healthcare delivery system with respect to hospital-based emergency and trauma services. Methods: This analysis examines changes in population demographics, hospital resources, and patient utilization patterns across facility types. Given the significant increase in the proportion of the population aged 65+ and the documented higher use of emergency and trauma services by this population, we expected to observe an expansion in ED and trauma service capacity and utilization. Results: Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of California general acute care hospitals over this 20+ year period, our descriptive analysis reveals major shifts in the healthcare delivery system, notably the increased prominence of hospitals with EDs, particularly those designated as trauma centers. Findings indicate that, while the overall number of hospitals and licensed beds has slightly decreased, facilities with EDs, especially trauma centers, have increased their capacity and manage a greater proportion of inpatient admissions and ED visits. Conclusions: The increase in ED visits and inpatient admissions at trauma centers, contrasted with decreases in both capacity and utilization at non-trauma hospitals, indicates a significant restructuring of the health delivery system with significant implications for healthcare policy, financing, operations, and affordability. The high and increasing percentage of inpatient admissions originating from hospital EDs and from hospitals with trauma centers suggests a need for policies that foster integration between ED and inpatient care and the broader healthcare delivery system, while at the same time managing the increase in prices and costs associated with growing emergency services utilization. Further research is needed to explore the implications of these trends, particularly concerning their impact on the affordability of healthcare in the US.
