The emphasis on sustainable and environmentally friendly practices in geotechnical engineering has generated interest in alternative soil stabilizing techniques. The present study examines the application of xanthan gum (XG) and guar gum (GG) to enhance the strength of a sand&amp;ndash;bentonite composite and explore their potential for use as landfill liners or impervious barriers. The mixtures, consisting of 25% bentonite and 75% sand, were treated with XG and GG concentrations of different percentages (0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 3% by dry mass). The test results indicated that a 2% addition was optimal for both biopolymers. Using this optimum value of XG and GG significantly increased the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) by almost 3-fold compared to the strength of untreated samples. Meanwhile, XG demonstrated a slightly higher impact on strength attributed to its robust gel-forming and binding properties. Comparisons between the two biopolymers highlighted XG&amp;rsquo;s superior performance, with UCS improvements of up to 20% over GG-treated samples. These results underscore the potential of biopolymers as effective, sustainable alternatives to traditional stabilizers, providing both mechanical enhancements and environmental benefits. The present study contributes valuable insights into green soil stabilization techniques, supporting the development of more sustainable construction practices. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was conducted to analyze the chemical interactions between sand&amp;ndash;bentonite mixtures and biopolymers, which possibly provide insights into the bonding mechanisms responsible for the observed improvements in mechanical and volumetric behavior.
