This study explores the transformative potential of smart classrooms in Chinese higher education. It investigates the impact of smart classrooms on student engagement, teaching effectiveness, and academic performance. A structured survey was administered to 547 respondents, covering demographics such as gender, age, educational level, field of study, socioeconomic status, and smart classroom experience. The study utilized SPSS software to analyze data through correlation analysis, ANOVA, outlier analysis, comparative analysis, and multiple regression. The findings reveal that smart classrooms significantly enhance student performance through digital interaction, collaborative learning, and active participation. Additionally, the adoption of these tools improves teaching quality and student outcomes, contributing to greater academic success and educational efficiency. Socioeconomic factors were found to affect the effectiveness of smart classrooms, leading to disparities in student outcomes. The study emphasizes the role of smart classrooms in promoting pedagogical innovation, learner-centered approaches, and personalized instruction. This research offers valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and researchers in Chinese higher education.
