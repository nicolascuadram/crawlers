From a Platonistic perspective, ideas are eternal and unchanging, constituting the foundation of reality. An idea itself does not change; it is a principle, immutable in essence. This approach inherently establishes a hierarchy, valuing the world of ideas&amp;mdash;understood as objective truth&amp;mdash;over the sensory world&amp;mdash;seen as deceptive and unstable. Against this backdrop, this paper examines the nature of musical ideas as they emerge from Marcel Proust&amp;rsquo;s work, exploring their potentially antiplatonistic implications and the philosophical insights they inspired in influential 20th-century thinkers.
