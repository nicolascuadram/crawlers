As the energy sector transitions toward decarbonisation, low-to-intermediate temperature geothermal resources in sedimentary basins—particularly repurposed oil and gas fields—have emerged as promising candidates for sustainable heat and power generation. Despite their widespread availability, the development of these systems is hindered by gaps in[...] Read more.
