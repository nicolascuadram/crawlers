Many of the commentators use the opportunity to highlight the value of Ergonomics and Human Factors (EHF) and challenge the notion that the discipline is fading. In response, we argue that EHF science is lagging behind the rapid developments in AI, remains entrenched in past-century achievements, and is in decline. Indices such as membership counts, conference attendance numbers, and new regulations reflect activity, but not necessarily impact. Important questions about human-AI collaboration are being addressed by other disciplines, often without the involvement of EHF. Rather than advocating for systemic frameworks, we advocate for new skill development and the adoption of data-driven AI methods. To illustrate the potential of AI within EHF, we demonstrate how a vision-language model can replicate findings from a classic knobs-and-dials study. In conclusion, we acknowledge EHF’s knowledge base but foresee existential risks unless the field undergoes major reforms to remain relevant in an AI-dominated future.
