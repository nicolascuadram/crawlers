AR advertising has become a powerful tool for promoting product presentation and evaluating brands, driving a stronger sense of presence that influences consumer decisions. Based on the Meaning maintenance model, this research investigates the effect of AR advertising on consumers’ willingness to purchase new products by exploring the possible role of perceived coolness as a mediator and consumers’ needs for uniqueness as a moderator. Through 2 experiments, the results reveal that perceived coolness mediates the relationship between AR advertising and new product purchases. Consumers’ needs for uniqueness moderate the effect of AR ads on consumers’ new product purchases. AR ads drive new product purchases for those with high uniqueness needs, while display ads are more effective for those with low uniqueness needs.
