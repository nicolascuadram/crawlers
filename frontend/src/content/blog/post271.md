This study aims to estimate nearshore wind conditions using multiple numerical models and evaluate their accuracy at heights relevant to offshore wind turbines. An intensive observation campaign was conducted from December 2021 to February 2022 at Mutsu Ogawara Port, Japan. The observed data were used to validate the accuracy of numerical models (mesoscale, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and linear models) to estimate wind conditions and investigate thermal environments, including atmospheric stability. The results demonstrated that the accuracy of period-averaged wind speed estimation in the offshore direction improved significantly when using an offshore observation point as a reference, with biases within &amp;plusmn;2.5% up to 5 km offshore for all models. However, the accuracy of vertical shear estimation varies widely among models, with several models overestimating vertical shear, particularly in the sea wind sector. The mesoscale model, which accounts for spatiotemporal variations in atmospheric stability, consistently achieves high estimation accuracy. In contrast, standalone CFD models, which typically assume neutral atmospheric stability, are difficult to estimate accurately. Nonetheless, incorporating specific atmospheric stability conditions into the CFD models significantly enhanced their accuracy. These findings underscore the importance of atmospheric stability when estimating offshore wind conditions, particularly in nearshore areas.
