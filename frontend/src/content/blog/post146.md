Rumen acidosis is a widespread digestive disorder in livestock, causing inflammation and lowering animal performance. Unraveling its molecular mechanisms is vital for improving cattle health and welfare. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are noncoding RNAs functioning as miRNA or protein sponges. This study employed high-throughput[...] Read more.
