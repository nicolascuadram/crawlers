Background: Recent studies indicate that physical activity (PA) may improve executive functions (EFs) in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The Enriched Motor Program (EMP), which combines aerobic and cognitive exercises, shows potential for enhancing EFs in these children. The EMP was originally created for typically developing preschoolers and includes locomotor and fine motor activities enriched by cognitive stimuli to help the development of EFs in children with ASD. The current study aims to adapt a shorter version of EMP for these children&amp;rsquo;s needs. Methods: The research will use a cross-sectional, quasi-experimental design with a forecasted sample of 40 children, with the age ranging from six to eight, with a diagnosis of ASD. The children&amp;rsquo;s working memory and inhibitory control will be measured before and after the intervention. Results: According to the literature, the experimental group should obtain higher scores, especially in working memory tasks. Discussion: This is the first implementation of EMP, which merges physical activities with cognitive stimuli to enhance EFs in children with ASD. It could be used by specialized centers and clinicians to support EFs through engaging activities, and it could be potentially recommended as a best practice for EF treatments in children with ASD.
