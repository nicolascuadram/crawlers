To address the precision challenges in upper-limb joint motion prediction, this study proposes a novel artificial neural network (COANN) enhanced by the Cheetah Optimization Algorithm (COA). The model integrates surface electromyography (sEMG) signals with joint angle data through multi-source information fusion, effectively resolving[...] Read more.
